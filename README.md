## MAJOR CHANGES TO APP PLANNED!
### (please read):

1. This project is being mothballed and re-implemented as another web app with a new name:
[Tempus Lunae](https://github.com/Umbra-Aeterna-Labs/tempus-lunae).
2. The current live web app will remain accessible until the successor is launched (possibly longer),
   so there should be no interruption in availability of these tools
3. I no longer have any game characters capable of Mushroom Farming, and that is unlikely to change.
Please remain patient when submitting issues or feature requests. I may not be able to address them in a timely 
manner, but it is my intention to get to all of them.

[LIVE WEB APP](https://umbra-aeterna-labs.github.io/phasepharmer)

PhasePharmer is a mushroom farming web app for 
[Project: Gorgon](https://projectgorgon.com) (an *excellent* MMORPG). 
The app calculates the current phase of the moon and provides useful 
fungal growth information for avid mushroom farmers.

It also provides 12 box timers to keep track of remaining growth time,
box type, and mushroom variety without having to log back into the game.

Please see the [Wiki](https://github.com/Umbra-Aeterna-Labs/PhasePharmer/wiki) for usage.
